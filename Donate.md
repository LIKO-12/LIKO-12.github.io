### Show me your support:

I've been working on LIKO-12 for about 3 years till now, and still actively developing it.

It would be very nice to support me for the long hours I've spent developing it :heart:

LIKO-12 is, and will always be a Free, Open-Source project !

There won't be ever any "PRO" or "Donator" editions by me or the official team (in the future).
